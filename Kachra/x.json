#### Multimodal AI:
- **Description**: Multimodal AI expands beyond traditional data processing to include various types of input like text, images, and sound.
- **Applications**: Enables models to process diverse sensory information, mimicking human abilities.
- **Example**: OpenAI's GPT-4 model can respond to visual and audio input, suggesting recipes based on images.
- **Benefits**: Enhances diagnostic accuracy in healthcare, extends design and coding capabilities, and offers new data for learning.

#### Agentic AI:
- **Definition**: Marks a shift from reactive to proactive AI, exhibiting autonomy and the ability to act independently.
- **Examples**: AI agents can collect data, analyze patterns, and take actions without direct human intervention.
- **Applications**: Used in environmental monitoring, financial management, and automation of tasks like reservations and trip planning.

#### Open Source AI:
- **Significance**: Reduces costs and expands AI access by allowing developers to build on existing code.
- **Engagement**: Generative AI projects saw increased developer engagement on platforms like GitHub.
- **Advantages**: Encourages transparency, ethical development, and democratized access to sophisticated AI models.

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation:
- **Purpose**: Addresses the issue of hallucinations in generative AI tools by enhancing accuracy and relevance.
- **Technique**: Blends text generation with information retrieval to produce more contextually aware responses.
- **Benefits**: Reduces model size, increases speed, and lowers costs in producing accurate AI-generated content.

#### Customized Enterprise Generative AI Models:
- **Focus**: Shifts towards smaller, narrow-purpose models catering to niche 
requirements for business use cases.
