#This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs.
#Note: In June 2023, OpenAI updated gpt-3.5-turbo. 
# The results you see in the notebook may be slightly different than those in the video. Some of the prompts have also been slightly modified to product the desired results.

# Note: This and all other lab notebooks of this course use OpenAI library version 0.27.0.

# ##### Prompting Principles

#### Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
#### Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
#### Tactics
############################################################
#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
#### Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, <tag> </tag>, :
#### Also helps protcet against  prompt injections
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \
providing instructions that are as clear and \
specific as you can possibly make them. \
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \
and context for the model, which can lead to \
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \
into a single sentence.
```{text}```

#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
#### JSON, HTML

Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \
water boiling. While that's happening, \
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \
cup of tea to enjoy.

Your task is to determine if the student's solution \
is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution \
and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
Question:

#### A note about the backslash
'''
In the course, we are using a backslash \ to make the text fit on the screen without inserting newline '\n' characters.
GPT-3 isn't really affected whether you insert newline characters or not. 
But when working with LLMs in general, you may consider whether newline characters in your prompt may affect the model's performance.
